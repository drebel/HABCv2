                <h3>Just because your loved one cannot speak doesn’t mean he/she is not trying to tell you something.</h3>
                <p>FACIAL EXPRESSIONS: Your loved one may no longer be as lively in their expressions as they once were. Often their face is rigid, but if you look carefully, you may see small changes that give clues about what they’re feeling.</p>
                <p>
                Signs of happiness:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower eyelids are crinkly</li>
                    <li>Cheeks are raised</li>
                    <li>The mouth smiles</li>
                </ul>
                Signs of sadness:
                <ul>
                    <li>The face droops</li>
                    <li>The mouth may tremble</li>
                </ul>
                Look for other nonverbal clues that can help you to determine what your loved one is trying to say.
                </p>
                <p>EYES: The eyes are the window to the soul. The eyes may show that your loved one is still present and aware, a person who deserves caring and respect. Look for widening or narrowing of the eyes, eye movement, tension in the lids and tears in the eyes. Always maintain eye contact when communicating with your loved one.</p>
                <p>
                    Look for signs that your loved one is not open to communication:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Backs away</li>
                        <li>Turns head or body away</li>
                        <li>Walks away</li>
                        <li>Frowns</li>
                        <li>Avoids eye contact</li>
                        <li>Pulls away from you</li>
                        <li>Shrinks away from being touched</li>
                        <li>Tells you to go away</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Continuing to interact with your loved one when he/she is non-receptive may lead to a catastrophic reaction.</h3>
                <p>INCREASED RESTLESSNESS such as pacing, fidgeting or rubbing body parts may indicate your loved one has to use the bathroom, has an infection or is anxious or upset.</p>
                <p>
                    When words fail, listen for clues in the speed, pitch and volume in your loved one’s VOCALIZATIONS.
                    <ul>
                        <li>A loud tone is more likely to cause concern than a quiet one</li>
                        <li>Speaking quickly indicates that your loved one may be losing self-control or feeling anxious; wait for him/her to calm down before approaching again</li>
                        <li>Try to guess what your loved one is saying unless your guesses annoy him/her</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
