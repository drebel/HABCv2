Advantages of HABC over other dementia assessments
most tools are more suited for research not clinical practice - they are lengthy and only conver particular domains
Clinical Dementia Rating is a gold standard for assessing severity of dementia but is very extensive and does not include behavioral and psychological symptoms related to dementia
Neurospsychiatric Inventory (NPI) has become widely used bc it does cover psych and behavior?
NPI is not practical bc of the time it takes to implement and doesnt cover functional or cognitive domains
Dementia Severity Rating Scale assesses cognitive and functional domains but not behavioral and is longer than HABC (several pages with 12 questions each)
Dementia Severity Scale covers cognitive, functional, behavioral but not mood (depression or anxiety) symptoms

HABC was not originally made as a screening tool but it does have decent screening proprties especially the cognitive subscore
HABC was developed primarily for assessing and monitoring the severity of dementia related symptoms 




we believe that the HABC-Monitor will benefit patients with Alzheimerâ€™s disease, their informal caregivers, and dementia care clinicians of all disciplines by providing clinicians with more frequent, more reliable, and more useful information, making it possible to modify care plans as needed to target problem symptoms more effectively. Better dementia symptom management improves quality of life for both the patient and their informal caregiver.
